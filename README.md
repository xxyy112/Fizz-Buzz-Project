The FizzBuzz Project is a simple programming exercise designed to practice basic coding concepts like loops, conditionals, and modular arithmetic. The goal is to print numbers from 1 to 
ùëÅ
N with the following rules:

Print "Fizz" for numbers divisible by 3.
Print "Buzz" for numbers divisible by 5.
Print "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.
Otherwise, print the number itself.
This project is often used in technical interviews and as an introductory exercise to teach logical thinking and problem-solving skills in programming.
